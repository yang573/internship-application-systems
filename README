YAPU - Yet Another Ping Utility
-------

This is by no means a complete ping utility, but it is what I could come up with over the weekend.

YAPU is written entirely in C for Linux. It was developed and tested on a Ubuntu Desktop 18.04.03 LTS.

This program uses RAW sockets, which require root permissions

* Building
```
make
```

* Running
```
sudo ./yapu ADDRESS
```

* Dev Notes
- The biggest difficulties with this project came from a lack of good documentation
	- Documentation for netinet/ip_icmp.h consisted mostly of header file sources
	- Almost no documentation exists for constructing ICMP packets along with the correct fields
- fping, liboping, etc. sources proved helpful but cumbersome
- If I had to redo this project, I would just learn Gopher and implement ping with that
